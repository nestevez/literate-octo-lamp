# Sharpie Wall

An updated version of the Django wall, created using C#. 

#### Two main pages:
* User Wall
* Topic Wall
  
Home page lists available topics as link to topic walls and prompts users to create new topics if unavailable.
User can access other user's walls by clicking on their names. User walls are like topic walls, but for the users - displaying profile information at the top of the page, followed by messages and comments.

This app includes user management.
